# RecOne

## Advanced Subdomain Enumeration, Port Scanning and Reconnaissance Automation

This script is created to assist security researchers in simplifying their work. It provides an automated solution for gathering subdomains, scanning ports, performing banner grabbing, and streamlining the reconnaissance process. With the script, researchers can easily collect subdomains associated with a target, check open ports on the target's network, retrieve banners from services running on those ports, and streamline the overall process of gathering valuable information for further analysis and investigation.

### Installation
To install and run the script, you'll need to do the following:

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/mbappzlogic/RecOne.git
```

### Usage
To use the script, run the following command:

```sudo chmod +x RecOne.sh
./RecOne.sh
```


Once executed, the script will present you with a menu of tasks to choose from, including options such as subdomain enumeration, port scanning, or reconnaissance. Upon selecting the desired task, you will be prompted to enter the target domain name. Once you provide this information, the script will take over and automate the specified task, streamlining the entire process for you.
